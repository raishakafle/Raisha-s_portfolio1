I am now in my second semester in the program Web Develeopment and Internet Applications, where I am creating a portfolio for myself..

I have created an index.html file which would become my home page.. Then I went on adding other various files to my project such as About, Contact Us, and Experience.

Next was giving appropriate css to the project. 

As I am trying to handle this project professionally I wanted to be precise of the different pages I would be working on and each page of css for all the individual css.
