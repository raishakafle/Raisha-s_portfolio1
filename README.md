I am now in my second semester in the program Web Develeopment and Internet Applications, where I am creating a portfolio for myself..

I have created an index.html file which would become my home page.. Then I went on adding other various files to my project such as About, Contact Us, and Experience.

Next was giving appropriate css to the project. 

As I am trying to handle this project professionally I wanted to be precise of the different pages I would be working on and each page of css for all the individual css.

After sorting out the individual css and also the individual styling for each the pages now I am starting to make changes to the css files.

I wanted to make this project a newspapery old schoool type of aesthetic and the fronting so I intend to follow a newspaper design poattern to it.

I now am trying to add some images to it, I am using photoshop to edit and properly shape my photos to add intop the project.

I have edited all the other pages including the experience pages, where I am adding upn all the projects I havew worked on until now so that I could use 
it up for my furture endaeveours.





Project Description
The portfolio is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and includes an index.html file which serves as the homepage. Additionally, I have created several other pages including an About page, Contact Us page, and Experience page.

To give the portfolio a professional look, I have utilized individual CSS for each page, providing a cohesive design throughout the website.

I am also following a newspaper design pattern to give the portfolio an old-school aesthetic. As part of this design, I am including appropriate images on the website. I am using Photoshop to edit and optimize these images to enhance the visual appeal of the portfolio.
