I am now in my second semester in the program Web Develeopment and Internet Applications, where I am creating a portfolio for myself..

I have created an index.html file which would become my home page.. Then I went on adding other various files to my project such as About, Contact Us, and Experience.

Next was giving appropriate css to the project. 

As I am trying to handle this project professionally I wanted to be precise of the different pages I would be working on and each page of css for all the individual css.

After sorting out the individual css and also the individual styling for each the pages now I am starting to make changes to the css files.

I nwanted to make this project a newspapery old schoool type of aesthetic and the fronting so I intend to follow a newspaper design poattern to it.

I now am trying to add some images to it, I am using photoshop to edit and properly shape my photos to add intop the project.
