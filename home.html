                My name is Raisha Kafle, someone who is passionate about designing.
                Be it a scrapbook, a powerpoint presentation, or a web page, since 
                I was a kid I have been very passionate about all these things which 
                I am very much proud of. Adding something creative to a work is like 
                adding spices to your food. You have to be creative for a good taste.
                One of the skills about myself that I would like to highlight is that 
                I am very creative. Be it about my writings, designs, art works, music 
                or anything about that matter. <br/><br/>

                Having to learn through all these cool skills with CSS, and actually
                getting to use them on a daily basis feels awesome! I have always been
                curious of how things work on the web, getting to know how everything
                works, getting to study everything in such detail makes me really happy. 
                And I feel really grateful to be where I am. <br/> <br/>

                I hope you enjoy going through my website as much as I did in making it.<br/> <br/>
                Regards.
