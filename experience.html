            Above are some of my work, through out the semester. First off, I have
            the project where we had to work on creating our work based on responsive
            design, where we had to mention a fixed device width, so that whenever the 
            tab gets minimised it can adjust according to the size of it. But, most
            importantly, varying on the device a particular user is using the size would
            be adjusted accordingly. <br/> <br/>

            A responsive design is something that allows your website content to flow freely
            across all screen resolutions and sizes, and renders it to look great on all 
            devices. It also makes it unnecessary to maintain different versions of your 
            website for mobile and desktop and saves you time, resources and efforts.
            <br/> <br/>

            For the second project, we were made familiar with how transitioning anything in 
            html works. For which I added, a hover along with transitioning the image, which 
            gave it a more sophisticated look which I really liked.

            For the third project, we were encouraged to create a website describing ones hobbies,
            and skills. I wanted to challenge myself with a different color where I chose pink, 
            mixing up with a touch of baby pink. At the end, the website actually turned out to be
            quite cute. <br/><br/>
            We were encoraged to be focusing on the text categories, including font weight, line 
            height, font style and many more. Furthermore, we have been taught working with vertical, 
            and horizontal navigations. We get to choose whichever works the best for us. That is what
            is giving in the fourth project.<br/> <br/>

            The fourth project, was based on the sea life around the globe, where not only I learnt 
            proper use of navigations but also some really fun facts about the sea life on earth. <br/> <br/>

            Overall, this was a really fun project moving along with, and I am really proud of how everything 
            has turned out.
