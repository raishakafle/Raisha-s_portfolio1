                      I moved to Canada, at the age of 19. <br/>
                      Where I started working at a fast food restraunt as a newbie.
                      Later, I joined in as a banquets server which I actually enjoyed. <BR/>

                      Currenlty, I work as a dietary aide, at a retirement facility. <br/>
                      I really enjoy my work and my workplace.

            I started off as a Biology major, during my high school time period. As I 
            studied through the semester I realised this field is not for me. After a 
            while of research I decided I would do best in Designing, which led me to
            Web Design and Internet applications. I am currenlty enrolled as a full time
            student at St. Clair College.<br/> <br/>
            
            I have always been fond of fond of music, I developed my interest in music at
            a very early age. I first started singing at the age of 5. Later, when I was 7
            I started playing violin. For me, music just adds up more life to life itself 
            and it is something that makes me the happiest! <br/><br/>

            Pictures express the things words could never. You get to express your feelings
            through the picture. This is one of my favorite hobbies, taking picture of random
            things, getting world to see things from your own perspective. This fact simply amuses
            me. <br/><br/>

            Sunsets for me, are magical. They have a power to calm you, despite the stress and all
            the overwhelming feelings. Just going out for some refreshment, getting to sit and 
            watch the beautiful sunset after a long long day is a feeling you can't explain. And 
            the after sunset view, late night walks are just my thing.I could never say no to sunsets
            and late night walks.

              I am a big cinephile! I could literally watch a whole season from a web series in a single
              day. I first started watching movies when I was six, and the rest is history.
              I can play several musical instruments! When I was around five, I developed my interest in
              music, that is when I started singing, at the age of seven, I started playing musical 
              instruments as well! <br/><br/> I can play four different musical instruments.Violin,
              Keyboard, Guitar,
              and Madal (a traditional Nepali instrument).
              Spicy foods define me! You would be surprised of how spicy food one can actually eat if you 
              met me. <br/><br/>
              Any given day, I would prefer spicy over sweet, sour anything else. My favorite spicy
              dish to eat would be the Korean Spicy noodles. Yes, and I definitely recommend people to try
              spicy foods!
